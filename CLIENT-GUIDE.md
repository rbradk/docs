# DIFFERENTIAL CLIENT GUIDE

## What happens after I say "yes" to Differential?

### You might have to wait a little

We're pretty awesome at what we do, so it might take us some time to
get your work into our schedule. We keep a very close eye on that schedule and strive to be extremely transparent with you. So yeah, it sucks to have to
wait, but it'll be worth it :)

### Who will do the work

There will be a single partner who is designated as your primary point of contact. The partners of Differential (employee-owners) drive all strategy and vision. To actually execute the work, we do a lot of it locally, but depending on work volume we also tap into development resources elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally. Rest assured that all the big decisions are made by the partners in Cincinnati, they will drive the vision for each user story, and we stand behind the work of our remote contributors.

### We'll iterate with working software

Building a MVP for a new product is a project with an "abundance" of
uncertainty. Some people try to mitigate that by doing a lot of
planning, writing a big spec document, talking, talking, talking...
Billing, billing, billing. We take a different approach.

We'll spend a tiny amount of time up-front building a queue of user stories (tasks based on the overall experience), and
choosing a batch to start on that if we delivered working software,
users could receive value by using it.

Then we will get working software in you and your users hands ASAP, and
deploy updates continuously. 

### Setting up source control, hosting, analytics, etc.

Once you're our client, we'll care about your business forever.

But we might not be your developer beyond the earliest days. We are
believers that once we uncover a market + product that people will pay
you for, it makes sense to recruit a team.

So we set everything up so it's easy for you to bring your new team
members into the project, and eventually removing us from those services
without having to do a incur a painful services switchover process.

## What happens after the MVP launches?

### Disappointment (bet you weren't expecting us to say that!)

We're a fan of [Pirate
Metrics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irjgfW0BIrw).

* Acquisition - how many users sign up
* Activation - how many users do enough intial activity to get value
  from your app
* Retention - do they come back? (your app is going to suck at this at
  first. Everyone's does.)
* Referral - do they tell others (nope, not at first.)
* Revenue - how much money are you generating (this will be close to
  zero for some time, unfortunately.)

So you launch. More likely than not, most of the numbers above are zero (or close to zero). Now we iterate to fix this.

### Concierge your first paid users

You'll need to go out, identify some people who will pay you for a
concierge service using your product. These users will be the best
source of learning for all 5 of the pirate metrics.

This is all you — super, super important though, if you want to build a
product that has a chance to be successful.

### Social media/marketing and operations and fundraising support

We'll provide a some support intrinsicly. However, we can provide some
paid services for non-development/design work too if you're severly lacking. 

## Do you have traction?

Traction is tricky. Getting more visits to your site is nice, but
doesn't pay bills. And generating a dollar of revenue that costs you
$1.60 is not very cool either.

It's all a big guess, until you actually have a profitable business,
whether you will ultimately get there.

If we sense you're onto something big, we'll want to stay very involved,
help with phase 2, try to get some equity in your venture in exchange
for discounted billing rates, etc.

If we don't love the traction, we might decide to scale down our
involvement. WE WILL NOT ABANDON YOU, THOUGH. And we'll always be
friends and will offer advice and support. But we won't do equity deals
with products we don't believe in.
